## Overview

Here I am with a new project, a new challenge, I really enjoyed doing this one because it's another opportunity to practice my css basics and flexbox, I also focused on the responisive part, I found the "vh" really helpful in this case(check the code for more details), I am looking for your feedbacks and suggestions.
Stay focused! don't forget your dreams! I know WebDev might be overwhelming sometimes, but PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. finally if you are reading this, please don't forget the importance of documentation and the comments as well, it makes the project more undertandable and the code more clear for you and for others checking your solution
